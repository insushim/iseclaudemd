# Deep Thinking Mode

> **Extended thinking for complex problems**

## Activation
This command enables deep, multi-step reasoning with maximum thinking budget.

## Process

### 1. Problem Understanding
```yaml
questions:
  - What is the core problem?
  - What are the constraints?
  - What are the success criteria?
  - What assumptions are we making?
```

### 2. Decomposition
Break the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.

### 3. Multi-Perspective Analysis
```yaml
perspectives:
  - Technical feasibility
  - User experience impact
  - Performance implications
  - Security considerations
  - Maintainability
```

### 4. Solution Exploration
- Generate multiple approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Consider edge cases

### 5. Synthesis
- Combine insights
- Form recommendation
- Document reasoning

## Output Format
